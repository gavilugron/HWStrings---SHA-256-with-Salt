I wrote this code to encrypt a name inutted by an user, also I worked with the package HashWithSalt that I've looked onto the web, and I encrypted the name in SHA-256 whit salt.
I used HashWithSalt just with the purpose of practice how to import a package and use their fuctions as same as I did whit ImputUtilities
